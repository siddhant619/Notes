#AWS Global Infrastructure
-Avaliability zones- Kind of like data centers in a region. We can deploy our application in multiple
avaliability zones and if one zone fails not gonna impact other avaliability zone.
-Region- Has at least two avaliability zones

# IAM - IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT
-Root account created by default when we create an account, shouldn’t be used or shared.
-Global sevice
-Users are people within ur organization that can be grouped
-Groups only contain users, not other groups
-A user can belong to multiple groups
-Why create users and groups - assign permissions
-Users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies(these define permissoins)

#Creating a user
-A user is assigned to a group (best practice) and permission policies are assigned to the group
so user inherits these permissions from the group.
-On the IAM dashboard there is a link so that users can open their console entering the username
and passord.
-Note that the account no. will be same for each user created from an account.

#IAM policies
-IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use 
to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the GetUser action, then a user
with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI,
or the AWS API.
-Inline policy- policy attached to a single user.
-A user can have more than one policies (coz a user can belong to more than one group 
and also the user can be assigned an inline policies all at the same time!).

#Protecting users -
1. IAM- password policies
Things like min passord length, specific charaters to include in password, allow all IAM Users
to change password, password expiration.
2. MFA(multi factor authoriaztion)

-Go to IAM->Account settings..

#Access AWS- Management console, CLI, SDK 

#IAM Roles for Services 
• Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
• To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
• Common roles:  EC2 Instance Roles, Lambda Function Roles, Roles for CloudFormation
AWS definition- An IAM role is an identity you can create that has specific permissions
with credentials that are valid for short durations. Roles can be assumed by entities
that you trust.
Hands on- 
Type of trusted entity is generally an AWS service(ec2, Lambda,)



# EC2 - ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD
-EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of :
    • Renting virtual machines (EC2)
    • Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    • Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    • Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
-An Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is a virtual server that you can use to run applications
in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- Iaas
- Bootstraping - means launching commands when a m/c starts(EC2 user data script 
is used to bootstrap our EC2 instances)
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks like-
    -Installing updates/software
    -downloading common files..etc
- EC2 user data script runs with root user (sudo)

#Creating ec2 instance
-EC2 Instance: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage +
security groups + EC2 User Data
-Choosing AMI(amazon m/c image)- An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration
 (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.
 Then choose instance type
There are other steps too.
-When restarting an ec2 instance the public IP changes but not pvt.

#EC2 instance types
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

#Security Groups
-Firewall attached to the EC2 instance(but its outside the instance)
Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances
Security groups only contain allow rules
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
They regulate: 
• Access to Ports 
• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6 
• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) 
• Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)
-If loading takes forever to load(timeout) then mp security group issue.

#SSH 
Control a m/c remotely using a command line.
In AWS we need to SSH into EC2 instance 

#To provide credentials to an EC2 instance attach IAM roles to the instance (never enter credentials directly!!,
since it will be accessible to all). 

#EBS volume
-An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach
to your instances while they run(kinda like network USB stick)
-We can attach a volume to an ec2 instance in the same avaliability zone as the volume.
-If we have delete on terminate option checked for an instance for ebs vol, then on deleting 
instance the vol get deleted
-EBS Snapshots -Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time.
Can be used to copy snapshots across AZ or Region

#AMI-  Amazon Machine image
-AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
• You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring…
• Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
-AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
-We can create an instance and then create an AMI using it (so the new AMI will include the 
user data script entered while creating that instance) .
So now we can create a new instance using the AMI created(choose my AMIs option instead of the
AMI given by default from AWS).

#EC2 image builder
https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/
-Used to automate creation, validation, maintain and test EC2 AMIs (can be run on schedule1)

#VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
-A virtual space into which we can launch our resources.
-A vpc is a logically isolated portion of the AWS cloud within a region. VPC always contained inside 
a region.
-Can have multiple VPCs in a region.
-Now we can create subnets within VPC. Subnets are created inside an avaliability zone.
-An internet gateway is used to connect to the internet.

#Security groups and network ACL
-Security group applies at instance level.We can apply a security group to one or multiple 
instances to control the traffic in and out of the EC2 instance.
-We create security for a VPC 
-While a network ACL applies at subnet level. So it only sees traffic in/out of the subnet
-A security group can be applied to instances in any subnet. Also a network ACL can be applied to
various subnets.
-By default inbound for security group-> It allows all traffic coming from the same security group. 
-Security group only supports allow rules. Network ACl has both allow and deny

#NOTE- The IP 0.0.0.0/0 means any IP address

#Stateful Firewall- Allows return traffic automatically. So no need to specify seperate rule.
Security group is Stateful Firewall
#Stateless Firewall- Checks for allow rule for both connections (return also).
Network acl is stateless

#Public and private services
Private services- Services that we create inside amazon VPC. eg ec2, rds, elastic file system.
Can have both public and private ip address (some control).
Public service- Have public IP address/endpoints. eg dynamoDB, s3, cloudfront  

#NAT gateway (nw address translation)
Forwards connections to the internet (outside world). Used by private instances(which are in private subnet)
to connect outbound to internet. NAT created in public subnets
