jQuery is a DOM manipulation library. It reads from and writes to the DOM. React uses a virtual DOM
 (a JavaScript representation of the real DOM). React only writes patch updates to the DOM, but never reads
 from it.It is not feasible to keep real DOM manipulations in sync with React's virtual DOM. Because of this,
 all jQuery functionality has been re-implemented in React.
